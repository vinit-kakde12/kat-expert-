const faqs = [
  { q: "Are these genuine student testimonials?", a: "Yes. Every video on this page is from an actual KATexpert student who consented to share their journey. We never use paid actors or scripted reviews." },
  { q: "Which exams are covered?", a: "We mentor students preparing for CAT, IPMAT, MBA CET, MCA CET and Campus Recruitment Training (CRT). Each program has dedicated faculty and curriculum." },
  { q: "How do I book counselling?", a: "Click any 'Book Free Counselling' button on this page. A counsellor will call you within 24 hours to understand your goals and recommend the right program." },
  { q: "Are classes online or offline?", a: "Both. Our Nagpur centre runs full offline batches, and we offer live online batches with recorded backup for students across India." },
  { q: "What makes KATexpert different?", a: "Small-batch mentorship, faculty who have themselves cracked these exams at top ranks, and a 25+ year track record of sending students to IIMs, JBIMS, VJTI and other top institutes." },
